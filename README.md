# ♦ Blackjack Simulator ♦
## Overview
This is a simple game made from scratch where the player plays 30 hands of blackjack against the dealer. Every hand is a $25 bet unless the player chooses to double down. 
Try to finish the game with a net-positive balance or just sit back and enjoy some blackjack with some nice relaxing music (thank you to LudoLoon Studio for the free music!).
